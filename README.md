# Tool Rental Application

The demonstration is to code and test a simple tool rental application.
* The application is a point-of-sale tool for a store, like Home Depot, that rents big tools.
* Customers rent a tool for a specified number of days.
* When a customer checks out a tool, a Rental Agreement is produced.
* The store charges a daily rental fee, whose amount is different for each tool type.
* Some tools are free of charge on weekends or holidays.
* Clerks may give customers a discount that is applied to the total daily charges to reduce the final
  charge.
